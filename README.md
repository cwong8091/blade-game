Card game from ToCS1

2 Players

Cards include 1-7, Bolt, and Mirror
Card 1, Bolt, and Mirror all have a card value of 1 if initially drawn
Bolt destroys the opposite players most recently played card
Mirror swaps the two players hands
1 revives a previously Bolted card (must be played after a Bolt for it to take effect)
Players will automatically lose if their last card is 1, Bolt, or Mirror

Flow of the Game
Each player draws 14 cards from their deck into their hand
Each player draws 1 card from the deck and places it face up on the field
Whichever player has the lowest value card goes first
If there is a draw, players discard all cards on the field and redraw from the deck
The player at the end with the highest summation of cards on the field wins
